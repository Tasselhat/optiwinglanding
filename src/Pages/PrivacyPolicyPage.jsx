          <br />
          <h2>2.1. WHAT BASIC INFORMATION DOES OPTIWING COLLECT?</h2>
          <p className="about-us-p">
            In operating the Site, we collect personal information from you in
            four situations. The first is if you sign up to our mailing list at
            which time we collect your email address. The second is if you
            should contact us via the “contact” page. In doing so, you will
            provide us with your name and email address. The third is if you
            leave a comment to a blog post during which you may be asked for a
            name and other information. The fourth is if you decide to use our
            application and sign up for an account, where we will collect your
            name, email, country of origin, and you may be asked for additional
            information. You are not required to provide us with information via
            these four methods to use and enjoy the Site.
          </p>
          <h2>2.2. WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
          <h2>(a) AUTOMATIC COLLECTION.</h2>
          <p className="about-us-p">
            Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP
            addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). No
            personal information about you is revealed in this process. The Site
            may also gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally
            identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for
            improving the services we offer.
          </p>
          <h2>(b) COOKIES.</h2>
          <p className="about-us-p">
            From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of
            major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of
            data on your computer about your visit to our Site. Cookies help us
            learn which areas of our Site are useful and which areas need
            improvement through programs including, but not limited to, Google
            Analytics. We may also use cookies from third party social sites and
            programs including, but not limited to, Facebook, Google Plus and
            Twitter. You can choose to disable cookies through your browser or
            independent programs available online. However, if you choose to
            disable this function, your experience at our Site may be diminished
            as some features may not work as they were intended.

          <h2>(c) SPONSORS AND ADVERTISERS.</h2>
          <p className="about-us-p">
            We may decide to accept sponsorship and advertisements on the Site.
            Should this occur, you should assume said sponsors and advertisers
            will be given access to the impressions and click data on their
            marketing pieces. Your personally identifiable information will
            never be revealed to them by us.
