			The map function in JavaScript is a robust tool that enables you to
			change the contents of an array of items into a new array that
			contains changed or updated items. Since it is a method of the Array
			prototype, any array instance in your code can call it. A callback
			function is the argument you supply to the map function to use it.
			Every element in the array will be subject to this callback
			function, and the callback's return value will be added to the new
			array. Three arguments are passed to the callback function: the
			array as a whole, the element currently being processed, and its
			index. Here is an example of using the map function to increase each
			element's value by two.
			<code>
				{`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
`}
			</code>
			It's critical to remember that the map function doesn't change the
			initial array. It keeps the original array untouched and generates a
			new array with the modified elements. This can be used to modify a
			copy of an array without changing the original data. The map
			function can be used to transform and manipulate data in a variety
			of ways in addition to the basic use that was previously
			illustrated. It's a valuable asset to have in your JavaScript
			toolbox and is frequently combined with other array methods like
			filter and reduce.
